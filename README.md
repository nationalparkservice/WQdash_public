# WQdash_public
A dashboard to make discrete water quality data from the Water Quality Portal more accessible to park resource managers by simplifying park-specific data import and summaries. 

This project will be fully documented once final changes are made. If this is your first time seeing/using the dashboard, you can email ellen_cheng@nps.gov to set up a meeting for a quick-start tutorial on dashboard use. If you want to bravely figure it out on your own, note that importing new datasets (the first step) fromthe  Water Quality Portal is best done at a time when agency (USGS, EPA, NPS) servers are less used--that means earlier in the day if you're closer to the East Coast and later in the day if you're closer to the West Coast.

Please use GitHub issues to report any problems or difficulties with the dashboard, or to make suggestions for improvement. BUT before posting an issue, search existing issues to see if it has already been reported.
